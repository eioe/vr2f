## Description

*List relevant information one needs to know about the code of this research project.
For instance, one could describe the computational model that was applied,
and which statistical approach has been chosen for.*

## Processing steps

### 0. Cleansing
...

### 1. Preprocessing

*General information regarding preprocessing could be written in the data [README.md](../data/README.md).
One could add here more implementation-specific information (e.g., which toolboxes were used).*

### 2. Decoding

...

### 3. ERPs

...

## Codebase

*Refer to the corresponding code/scripts written for the analysis/simulation/etc.
Which languages (Python, R, Matlab, ...) were used? Are there specific package versions,
which one should take care of? Or is there a container (e.g., Docker) or virtual environment?*

### Python

Python code (in the structure of a python package) is stored in `./code/vr2f/`

To install the research code as package, run the following code in the project root directory:

```shell
pip install -e ".[develop]"
```

#### Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are stored in `./code/notebooks/`

### R

*Initialize a new R-project in the project root of `vr2f` with `RStudio`.
R-scripts can be stored in `./code/Rscripts/`.
Use R-packages in Python with, e.g., [rpy2](https://rpy2.github.io/), or use Python packages in R using,
e.g., [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)*.

### Configs

Paths to data, parameter settings, etc. are stored in the config script: `./code/vr2f/staticinfo.py`


## COPYRIGHT/LICENSE

*One could add information about code sharing
(e.g., is the code published on GitLab or GitHub ...),
license and copy right issues*
