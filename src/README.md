*General information regarding preprocessing could be written in [README_data.md](../Data/README_data.html). One could add here more implementation specific information (e.g., which toolboxes were used)*

## Codebase
*Refer to the corresponding code/scripts written for the analysis. Which languages (Python, R Matlab, ...) where used? Are there specific package versions, which one should take care of? Or is there a container (e.g, Docker) or virtual environment?*

## COPYRIGHT/LICENSE
